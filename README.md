**usecontext hook:**

mainly usecontext is used for passing the data to deep into the DOM tree.
for example: 
if you have to use one component logic to many components instead of passing props we can use the usecontext hook for better performance.

In this appliction i used usecontext hook for developing the count and displaying the products in the appliction.
i used adding the products to the cart and displaying the coount of the products in diaply component and count in count component.
